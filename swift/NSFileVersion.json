When managing local versions, the document architecture creates versions at specific points in the lifetime of your application. Your application can also create versions explicitly at times that your application designates as appropriate. \nIn addition to managing local files, the system also uses this class to manage cloud-based files. For files in the cloud, there is usually only one version of the file at any given time. However, additional file versions may be created in cases where two different computers attempt to save the file to the cloud at the same time. In that case, one file is chosen as the current version and any other versions are tagged as being in conflict with the original. Conflict versions are reported to the appropriate file presenter objects and should be resolved as soon as possible so that the corresponding files can be removed from the cloud.\n", "class_name": "NSFileVersion"}
