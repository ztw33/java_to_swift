Dispersion is a dimensionless quantity that is commonly expressed in \u201cparts-per\u201d notation, such as \u201cparts per million\u201d (ppm), to describe small relative quantities.\nThe NSUnitDispersion class defines its base unit as partsPerMillion.\nName\nMethod\nAbbreviation\nParts Per Million\npartsPerMillion\nppm\n", "class_name": "UnitDispersion"}
