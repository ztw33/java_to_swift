The NSMeasurement class provides a programmatic interface to converting measurements into different units, as well as calculating the sum or difference between two measurements.\nNSMeasurement objects are initialized with an Unit object and double value. NSMeasurement objects are immutable, and cannot be changed after being created.\nYou can use the MeasurementFormatter class to create localized string representations of NSMeasurement objects.\nImportant\nThe Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the Measurement structure, which bridges to the NSMeasurement class.
