This command corresponds to AppleScript\u2019s make command.\nNSCreateCommand is part of Cocoa\u2019s built-in scripting support. Most applications don\u2019t need to subclass NSCreateCommand or invoke its methods.\nWhen an instance of NSCreateCommand is executed, it creates a new object using [[theClassToBeCreated allocWithZone:NULL] init] (where theClassToBeCreated is the class of the object to be created), unless the command has a with data argument. In the latter case, the new object is created by invoking [[NSScriptCoercionHandler sharedCoercionHandler] coerceValue:theDataAsAnObject toClass:theClassToBeCreated].  Any properties specified by a with properties argument are then set in the new object using -setScriptingProperties:.\nIf an NSCreateCommand object with no argument corresponding to the at parameter is executed (for example, tell application \"Mail\" to make new mailbox with properties {name:\"testFolder\"}), and the receiver of the command (not necessarily the application object) has a to-many relationship to objects of the class to be instantiated, and the class description for the receiving class returns false when sent an isLocationRequiredToCreateForKey: message, the NSCreateCommand object creates a new object and sends the receiver an insertValue(_:at:inPropertyWithKey:) message to place the new object in the container. This is part of Cocoa\u2019s scripting support for inserting newly-created objects into containers without explicitly specifying a location.\n", "class_name": "NSCreateCommand"}
