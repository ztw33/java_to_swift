The SI unit for electric potential difference is the volt (V), which is derived as the difference in electric potential energy between two points of a linear conductor when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points (1V = 1W/1A).\nThe NSUnitElectricPotentialDifference class defines its base unit as volts, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nCoefficient\nMegavolts\nmegavolts\nMV\n1000000.0\nKilovolts\nkilovolts\nkV\n1000.0\nVolts\nvolts\nV\n1.0\nMillivolts\nmillivolts\nmV\n0.001\nMicrovolts\nmicrovolts\n\u00b5V\n0.000001\n", "class_name": "UnitElectricPotentialDifference"}
