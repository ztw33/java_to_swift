Cocoa creates an NSDeleteCommand object to perform the operation. When the command is executed, it uses the key-value coding mechanism (by invoking removeValueAtIndex:fromPropertyWithKey:) to remove the specified object or objects from their container. See the description for removeValue(at:fromPropertyWithKey:) for related information.\nNSDeleteCommand is part of Cocoa\u2019s built-in scripting support. Most applications don\u2019t need to subclass NSDeleteCommand or call its methods.\n", "class_name": "NSDeleteCommand"}
