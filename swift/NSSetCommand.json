It works automatically to support the set command through key-value coding. Most applications don\u2019t need to subclass NSSetCommand or call its methods.\nNSSetCommand uses available scripting class descriptions to determine whether it should set a value for an attribute (or property), or set a value for all elements (to-many objects). For the latter, it invokes replaceValue(at:inPropertyWithKey:withValue:); for the former, it invokes setValue(_:forKey:) (or, if the receiver overrides takeValue:forKey:, it invokes that method, to support backward binary compatibility.)\nFor information on working with set commands, see Getting and Setting Properties and Elements in Cocoa Scripting Guide.\n", "class_name": "NSSetCommand"}
