These operators are equivalent to \u201c&&\u201d, \u201c||\u201d, and \u201c!\u201d in the C language.\nFor AND and OR operations, an NSLogicalTest object is typically initialized with an array containing two or more NSSpecifierTest objects. isTrue()\u2014inherited from NSScriptWhoseTest\u2014evaluates the array in a manner appropriate to the logical operation. For NOT operations, an NSLogicalTest object is initialized with only one NSSpecifierTest object; it simply reverses the Boolean outcome of the isTrue() method.\nYou don\u2019t normally subclass NSLogicalTest.\n", "class_name": "NSLogicalTest"}
