Applications that are intended for deployment in macOS 10.3 or later should use NSURLConnection or NSURLDownload instead; see URL Session Programming Guide.\nCocoa provides private concrete subclasses to handle HTTP and file URL schemes. If you want to implement support for additional URL schemes, you would do so by creating a subclass of NSURLHandle. You can use NSURL and NSURLHandle to download from FTP sites without subclassing.\n", "class_name": "NSURLHandle"}
