The SI unit for time is the second (sec), which is defined in terms of the radioactivity of a cesium-133 atom. Duration is also commonly expressed in terms of minutes (min) and hours (hr).\nNote\nUse the NSDateComponents class to represent quantities of calendrical units, such as days, weeks, months, and years.\nThe NSUnitDuration class defines its base unit as seconds, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nCoefficient\nSeconds\nseconds\nsec\n1\nMinutes\nminutes\nmin\n60\nHours\nhours\nhr\n3600\n", "class_name": "UnitDuration"}
