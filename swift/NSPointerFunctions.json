There are constants for common personalities and memory manager selections (see Memory and Personality Options).\nNSHashTable, NSMapTable, and NSPointerArray use an NSPointerFunctions object to define the acquisition and retention behavior for the pointers they manage. Note, however, that not all combinations of personality and memory management behavior are valid for these collections. The pointer collection objects copy the NSPointerFunctions object on input and output, so you cannot usefully subclass NSPointerFunctions.\nNSPointerFunctions is not suitable for subclassing.\n", "package_name": "foundation"}
