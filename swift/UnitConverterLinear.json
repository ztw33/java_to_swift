The valueFromBaseUnitValue: method performs the inverse conversion in the form of x = (y - b) / m, where y represents the value passed in and x represents the value returned.\nFor example, consider the fahrenheit unit defined by UnitTemperature: The baseUnitValueFromValue: method calculates the value in the base unit, kelvin using the formula K = (0.55555555555556) \u00d7 \u00b0F + 255.37222222222427, and the valueFromBaseUnitValue: method calculates the value in fahrenheit using the formula \u00b0F = (K \u2014 255.37222222222427) / (0.55555555555556), where the coefficient is (0.55555555555556) and the constant is 255.37222222222427.\nUnits that perform conversion using only a scale factor have a coefficient equal to the scale factor and a constant equal 0. For example, consider the kilometers unit defined by UnitLength: The baseUnitValueFromValue: method calculates the value in meters using the formula valueInMeters = 1000 * valueInKilometers + 0, and the valueFromBaseUnitValue: calculates the value in kilometers using the formula valueInKilometers = (valueInMeters - 0) / 1000, where the coefficient is 1000 and the constant is 0.\n", "class_name": "UnitConverterLinear"}
