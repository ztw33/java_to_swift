For more information on NSSpecifierTest, see the method description for its sole public method, its initializer, init(objectSpecifier:comparisonOperator:test:).\nWhen an NSSpecifierTest object is properly initialized, it holds two objects:\nA \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201ctest\u201d object used as the basis of the comparison; this object can be a regular object or object specifier (such as \u201cblue\u201d in \u201cwords whose color is blue\u201d).\nAn object specifier evaluating to the container (\u201cwords\u201d). \nThe instance also encapsulates a selector identifying the method performing this comparison. The informal protocol NSComparisonMethods defines a set of comparison methods useful for this purpose, while NSScriptingComparisonMethods describes additional methods you may need to use for scripting.\nThe test object is compared, using the selector, against each object in the container. Specifiers in these tests usually have containerIsObjectBeingTested invoked on their topmost container.\nYou should rarely need to subclass NSSpecifierTest.\n", "class_name": "NSSpecifierTest"}
