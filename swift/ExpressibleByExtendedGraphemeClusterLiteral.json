{"class_description": "An extended grapheme cluster is a group of one or more Unicode scalar values that approximates a single user-perceived character.  Many individual characters, such as \u201c\u00e9\u201d, \u201c\uae40\u201d, and \u201c\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\u201d, can be made up of multiple Unicode scalar values. These code points are combined by Unicode\u2019s boundary algorithms into extended grapheme clusters.\nThe String, StaticString, and Character types conform to the ExpressibleByExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral protocol. You can initialize a variable or constant of any of these types using a string literal that holds a single character.\nTo add ExpressibleByExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral conformance to your custom type, implement the required initializer.\n", "package_name": "swift", "interface_list": [], "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["ExpressibleByUnicodeScalarLiteral"], "Vars": [], "subclass_list": ["ExpressibleByStringLiteral"], "class_name": "ExpressibleByExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral"}
