Threads are especially useful when you need to perform a lengthy task, but don\u2019t want it to block the execution of the rest of the application. In particular, you can use threads to avoid blocking the main thread of the application, which handles user interface and event-related actions. Threads can also be used to divide a large job into several smaller jobs, which can lead to performance increases on multi-core computers.\nThe Thread class supports semantics similar to those of Operation for monitoring the runtime condition of a thread. You can use these semantics to cancel the execution of a thread or determine if the thread is still executing or has finished its task. Canceling a thread requires support from your thread code; see the description for cancel() for more information.\nYou can subclass Thread and override the main() method to implement your thread\u2019s main entry point. If you override main(), you do not need to invoke the inherited behavior by calling super.\n", "class_name": "Thread"}
