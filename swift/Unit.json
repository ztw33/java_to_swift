The Foundation framework provides several concrete Dimension subclasses to represent the most common physical quantities, including mass, length, duration, and speed.\nNSUnit is intended for subclassing. For dimensional units, you should use one of the Apple provided Dimension subclasses listed in Table 1, or create a custom subclass of Dimension. You can create a direct subclass of NSUnit to represent a custom dimensionless unit, such as a count, score, or ratio.\n", "class_name": "Unit"}
