It is intended to execute user-supplied scripts and will execute them outside of the application's sandbox, if any.\nThe class is not intended to execute scripts built into an application; for that, use one of the Process classes. If the application is sandboxed, then the script must be in the FileManager.SearchPathDirectory.applicationScriptsDirectory folder. A sandboxed application may read from, but not write to, this folder.\nIf you simply need to execute scripts without regard to input or output, use NSUserScriptTask, which can execute any of the specific types. If you need specific control over the input to or output from the script, use this class.\n", "class_name": "NSUserAppleScriptTask"}
