Speed can be expressed by SI derived units in terms of meters per second (m/s), and is also commonly expressed in terms of kilometers per hour (km/h) and miles per hour (mph).\nThe NSUnitSpeed class defines its base unit as metersPerSecond, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nCoefficient\nMeters Per Second\nmetersPerSecond\nm/s\n1.0\nKilometers Per Hour\nkilometersPerHour\nkm/h\n0.277778\nMiles Per Hour\nmilesPerHour\nmph\n0.44704\nKnots\nknots\nkn\n0.514444\n", "class_name": "UnitSpeed"}
