For more detail, see the documentation for the APIs used by each platform.\nApple platforms use arc4random_buf(3).\nLinux platforms use getrandom(2) when available; otherwise, they read from /dev/urandom.\n", "Methods": [{"return_value": {"return_description": ["An unsigned 64-bit random value."], "return_name": [""], "return_type": ["UInt64"]}, "method_description": "Returns a value from a uniform, independent distribution of binary data.", "method_name": "next", "class_name": "SystemRandomNumberGenerator", "params": []}, {"return_value": {"return_description": ["A random value of T.
