It works automatically to support the move AppleScript command through key-value coding. Most applications don\u2019t need to subclass NSMoveCommand or invoke its methods. However, for circumstances where you might choose to subclass this command, see \"Modifying a Standard Command\" in Script Commands in Cocoa Scripting Guide.\nWhen an instance of NSMoveCommand is executed, it does not make copies of moved objects. It removes objects from the source container or containers, then inserts them into the destination container.\n", "class_name": "NSMoveCommand"}
