Acceleration can be expressed by SI derived units in terms of meters per second squared (m/s2).\nThe NSUnitAcceleration class defines its base unit as metersPerSecondSquared, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nCoefficient\nMeters Per Second Squared\nmetersPerSecondSquared\nm/s\u00b2\n1.0\nGravity\ngravity\ng\n9.81\n", "class_name": "UnitAcceleration"}
