An Pipe object represents both ends of a pipe and enables communication through the pipe. A pipe is a one-way communications channel between related processes; one process writes data, while the other process reads that data. The data that passes through the pipe is buffered; the size of the buffer is determined by the underlying operating system. Pipe is an abstract class, the public interface of a class cluster.\n", "class_name": "Pipe"}
